# websiteVulnerabilityScanner
This is a copy of my Senior year capstone project. The website takes in a public websites URL and outputs the security headers implemented. 
The only security headers we are looking for are those found on the OWASP top 10 list for 2023.

# index.php
This is the homepage for the php style website. This is where the user inputs a websites url. To submit the form request, the user clicks a submit button.

# pythonFiles.py
Once the user clicks submit, the scanResults.php page is displayed. This php file runs the Python code on the backend. The Python code accesses the websites security
headers and stores them in a list. The python code compares the stored security headers to the ones located in the owasp.json file. If there are any matches, the 
header is kept and printed to the user. Along with the header is a brief description of the functions of each header.

# scanResults.php
Once the Python code is executed, the user is displayed a brief synopsis of their given website. Each header is briefly described. The inputted website is then 
given a security grade (A, B, C, etc.) based on how many security headers from the OWASP top 10 list are implemented.

# style.css
This is the average cascading style sheet taught at Randolph-Macon College. This was used to set background colors, change text fonts, add headers and footers. 
In the header is the name of the website followed by the logo of the website on both sides. The footer contains useful websites like the OWASP top 10 list, the CISA
homepage, and the Black Hat homepage.
